      <h2>Managing Async With RxJS 5: Course Overview</h2>
      <p>This is a 3 part course complete with pre-course videos, an interactive workshop day, and post workshop support.</p>
      <p>Learn about RxJS 5 and Observables in-depth, and using RxJS to manage common and complex async scenarios within an application.</p>
      <p>
        Thinking in functional reactive programming can be difficult, but we will give you some fundamentals to go about composing streams.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of this course you'll have built an application that uses both HTTP and WebSockets to create a realtime streaming application.
